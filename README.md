# mnist_net

The project includes code to train a neural network to recognise handwritten digits. The data is taken from the MNIST data set.

## Getting started

To install all dependencies run pip install -r requirements.txt and start the programm with python3 main.py. 
Also install the MNIST data set from the website http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ into a new folder named "mnist_data".

## Problem description

Eventhough in the current version both neural networks "main.py" and "cnn_main.py" should lead to the same results, since they use very similar functions, 
the training effect of the latter appears to be much worse.
